**About Dataset:** 
The Oil Spill Dataset provides a comprehensive collection of satellite images of the ocean, where some sections contain oil spills while others do not. Utilizing computer vision algorithms, these images were processed to extract features describing the contents of each image patch. The primary task is to predict whether a given patch contains an oil spill, distinguishing between spill (positive case) and non-spill (negative case) instances. With 50 columns in total, the output column is labeled as 'target'.

**Questions Solved:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing:** The dataset underwent rigorous data cleaning and pre-processing to handle null values, perform one-hot encoding, imputation, and scaling where necessary, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
  
2. **Insights Derivation:** Insights were derived from the dataset, uncovering patterns, trends, and potential correlations between various features and the occurrence of oil spills, providing valuable understanding of oceanic dynamics.

3. **Machine Learning Techniques Application:** Various machine learning techniques, including Bagging and Ensemble methods, were applied to predict the target column. The models were evaluated using robust model evaluation techniques to identify the best-performing model.

4. **Model Saving and Loading:** The best-performing model was saved for future use, and the process of loading the model was demonstrated, ensuring seamless integration into future projects or applications.

5. **Dataset Transformation and Model Application:** A new dataset was created by randomly selecting 20 data points from the oil spill dataset. The saved model was then applied to this new dataset, showcasing the model's predictive capabilities on unseen data.
